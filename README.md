# hello-world
Test. First repository. New to GitHub, software, and programming. Looking to explore the tech world more in-depth.

Hello world! My name's David, and I'm currently an undergraduate student at Northeastern University studying finance. I've been interested in software and programming for a long time, but have never taken action to learn how to code and create something that I can call my own. Now, I've decided to act on this curiosity that has possessed me for so long and can't wait to see where my aspirations take me!
